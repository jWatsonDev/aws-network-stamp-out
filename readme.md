# Terraform Project

This project uses Terraform to manage infrastructure as code.

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed on your machine.
- Properly configured cloud provider credentials.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. **Initialize the Terraform working directory:**

    ```sh
    terraform init
    ```

3. **Review the execution plan:**

    ```sh
    terraform plan
    ```

4. **Apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration:**

    ```sh
    terraform apply
    ```

## Project Structure

- `main.tf`: The primary configuration file where the main resources are defined.
- `variables.tf`: Contains the variable definitions.
- `outputs.tf`: Contains the output definitions.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

## Best Practices

- Keep your `.tfstate` files secure and do not share them.
- Use `.tfvars` files to manage sensitive variables and add them to `.gitignore`.
- Regularly run `terraform plan` to review changes before applying them.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
6. Create a new Pull Request.
